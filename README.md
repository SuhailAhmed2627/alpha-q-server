# Alpha Q - Sever Setup👨‍💻
A bunch of shell scripts to setup Alpha Q server. Yes, I get the Pun in the name.

**NOTE**: Have not been able to Dockerise yet. Will upload dockerised and Apache hostable Version soon. Sorry.

## Why?
[Delta](https://delta.nitt.edu/)'s Induction Task-1&2. Used Bash, awk, grep and several other cool things about bash. Learned express.js and MySQL database and their awesome fucntions.
